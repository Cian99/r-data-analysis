## Simple Example

I have created some data and have calculated some numerical and graphical summaries.

These are the data:
```{r create data and calculate mean}

data1 <- c(10, 23,14,12,34,26,28,58,61)

```

The mean is:
```{r}

mean(data1)

```

The summary statistics are:
```{r}

summary(data1)

```

A boxplot would look like:
```{r}

boxplot(data1)

```


And a histogram:
```{r}

hist(data1)

```
