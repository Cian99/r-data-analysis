# R Programming Assignments
This repository contains some simple R programming assignments in Comp Systems and Statistics

## Comp Systems
### Dice Roll Simulation
This program simulates rolling two six-sided dice 100 times, calculates the sum of each roll, and analyzes the results through frequency tables and statistical measures like the median. It also visualizes the distribution of the sums using a histogram with ggplot2.
### Flight Data Analysis
This script reads flight data from an Excel file and uses ggplot2 to create various visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots, to analyze flight patterns by time, airport, and the relationship between departure and arrival delays.

## Statistics
### Data Summary Eg
This R Markdown document is designed to be knitted into a Word document. It demonstrates the creation of a numeric dataset, the calculation of its mean and summary statistics, and includes visualizations such as a boxplot and histogram to illustrate the distribution of the data.
### Training Intervention Analysis
This R Markdown document analyzes the effects of a training intervention on squat performance. It imports training data, calculates summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) for pre- and post-intervention squat measurements, and visualizes the results using scatter plots and box plots. The document also computes confidence intervals and tolerance intervals for the improvement in squat performance, concluding that the data indicates a significant improvement after the training program.
